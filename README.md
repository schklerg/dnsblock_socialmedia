DNS Based blocking for social media sites

If you've ever watched the traffic coming from your computer you will notice how much sites and apps reach out to Facebook and other Social Media sites.

To that end, here are DNS lists to block Facebook & their other properties.  I also added a file for Crashlytics.  Frankly, I don't know much about them, but a lot of apps appear to send them telemetry.

Confirmed to work with Adaway, but I imagine it works with other DNS based blockers.
