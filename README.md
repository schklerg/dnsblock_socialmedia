DNS Based blocking for social media sites

If you've ever watched the traffic coming from your computer you will notice how much sites and apps reach out to Facebook and other Social Media sites.

To that end, here are DNS lists to block Facebook & their other properties.  I also added a file for Crashlytics.  Frankly, I don't know much about them, but a lot of apps appear to send them telemetry.

Confirmed to work with [Adaway](https://adaway.org/), but I imagine it works with other DNS based blockers.

* dns_facebook.txt will take care of most of Facebooks tracking
* dns_instagram.txt will also block calls to Instagram, which is owned by Facebook
* dns_whatsapp.txt will block calls to WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook
* dns_crashlytics.txt blocks telemetry reporting to Crashlytics.  They don't seem to do aggressive tracking, but if you are not a fan of telemetry, add this.
* dns_youtube.txt is my attempt to block ads in Youtube.  Not sure how effective yet.

Have not done anything with this.  WOW
**NOTE**  In case it's not obvious, using these blocklists will block these sites entirely for your system.  Use at your own discretion.
